Stellar is an open-source network optimized for payments and asset issuance. On Stellar, you can create, send, and trade digital representations of all forms of value — U.S. dollars, Argentine pesos, Bitcoin, real estate, pretty much anything. It’s designed so all the world’s financial systems can freely interoperate with each other, all on a single network.

As a public network, Stellar has no owner; if anything it’s owned by the public. The software runs across a decentralized, open network and handles millions of transactions each day. Like Bitcoin and Ethereum, Stellar relies on blockchain to keep the network in sync, but the end-user experience is more like cash — Stellar is much faster, cheaper, and more energy-efficient than typical blockchain-based systems.
